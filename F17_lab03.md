# CS56 Utilities Payment Method Validator
## Introduction
Compliance with (a).
The purpose of our project is to replace the CS56 Utilities Payment Method Validator desktop app with an applicable web appliication. Further, the web application will include bugfixes with regards to the functionality of the desktop app.
## Current Functionality
Compliance with (b), (c).
Currently the user may generate up to one credit card number at a time.
The feature to generate more than one credit card number at a time is nonfunctional.

### Current use case scenarios

#### Scenario 1:
User runs app locally on system. User generates credit card with any desired card type, and the option of Generater Count = 1. The generator generates a single card number.

#### Scenario 2:
User runs app locally on system. User generates credit card with any desired card type, and the option of Generater Count = >1. The generator generates a single card number. This is a bug.

#### Scenario 3:
User runs app locally on system. User validates credit card with any desired card type. The generator validates the card number.



## Future Functionality
Compliance with (d), (g), (h)

When our app is complete, we wish for the following scenarios to be additonally possible.

#### Scenario 1:
User runs app by connecting to URL on browser. User submits option to generate credit card with any desired card type, and the option of Generater Count = 1. The app generates a single card number.

#### Scenario 2:
User runs app by connecting to URL on browser. User submits option to generate credit card with any desired card type, and the option of Generater Count >= 1. The app generates a the desired number of card numbers.

#### Scenario 3:
User runs app by connecting to URL on browser. User submits option to validate credit card with any desired card type. The app validates the card number.

#### Scenario 4:
User runs app by connecting to URL on browser. User submits option to validate bitcoin address. The app validates the bitcoin address.

The current issues consitute for the creation of an entirely different application, with different frameworks as appropriate.
There are certainly enough issues to earn 1,000 points. The expectations are clear.

In terms of functionality, we can certainly add the feature to validate Bitcoin addresses. With the advent of crypto-currency, this is certainly a useful feature.

## Evaluation of Current Materials and Code
Compliance with (e), (f), (i), (j)
Because we aim to construct a web app, and the current app is a desktop app, much of the code is irrelevant to our project, and will not be salvaged. The generation and verification algorithims used in the desktop app will be reimlemented in the webapp.

The project does have test coverage, but again, much of the code within this project will not be salvaged.

Likewise, the readme and the build.xml file will not be of particular use to our project, because we are essentially rewriting the entire project as a webapp.
