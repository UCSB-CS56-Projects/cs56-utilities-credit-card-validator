The code did not initially compile due to hard-coded JUnit classpath (not initially compiled at CSIL)

The issues were fairly clear:

1) Code needed to be put into a package and moved corresponding to package file-structure. Did not mention the need to change build.xml

2) Change program interface from command-line to graphic. Pretty simple, add a GUI

3) Add a feature where users can choose which type of credit card number they would like to generate (e.g. Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc.). Turns out that the numbers actually follow a pattern according to which type of credit card they correspond to.

 4) Add repo-local JUnit .jar so that code will compile (was not clear about the need to change build.xml accordingly)


 We add an issue to fix the methods that generate a random credit card number. The algorithm is not actually producing a valid card number. This still has to be fixed.
